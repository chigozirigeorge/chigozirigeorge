🚀 Rust & React Developer | Blockchain & Real Estate Tech 🔧 Building VeriNest – Blockchain-Powered Property Verification

I specialize in building high-performance systems with Rust 🦀 and crafting seamless web experiences with React ⚛️. Currently, I am developing VeriNest, a blockchain-based platform revolutionizing real estate by enabling secure property verification, sales, and rentals.

💡 What I Bring:

Rust: Secure, efficient backend systems, smart contracts, and CLI tools

React: Modern, user-friendly interfaces for complex applications

Blockchain: Decentralized solutions for trustless transactions (Ethereum/Solana?)

Problem-Solving: Turning real-world challenges into scalable tech solutions

🌱 Deep Dive: Blockchain integrations, Web3.js/ethers.js, and decentralized identity (DID) for real estate

Let’s innovate the future of property tech—or just geek out about Rust! 🦀🚀
